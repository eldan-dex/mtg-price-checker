# MTG Price Checker
A simple web-based price checker made to optimize purchases of Magic: The Gathering cards

How it works:
* Paste a list of cards into the left slot and submit
* Price checker will look up the given cards on all available stores and display a table of results
* The best price, along with the store where this price came from, will be displayed in the rightmost columns
* Happy shopping!

Notes:
* Currently only the five major czech MTG card stores are supported (cernyrytir.cz, najada.cz, blacklotus.cz, rishada.cz, mysticshop.cz)
* Frontend is in czech
* Issues in this repo are in czech
* If you wish to use the site or contribute and prefer english, let me know, this can be arranged
